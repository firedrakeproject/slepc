<h2>Direct Solver (or Dense System) - DS</h2>

<p>
The DS package provides auxiliary routines that are internally used by the different SLEPc solvers. It is used to represent low-dimensional eigenproblems that must be solved within iterative solvers with direct methods. It can be seen as a structured wrapper to LAPACK functionality.
</p>
<p>
These routines are usually not needed by application programmers.
